<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Global Default Security</span></p>
<p>Global security is organized by Tabs (Organization/Department Tab, Project Tab, and People Tab). Simply click on the default security settings on the right side of the Site Admin page, and review the default settings to see if these are the desired settings.  If not, change them at the global level and propagate each change. Access to different parts of the application can be given to specific employees or groups of employees.</p>
<p>This access can be set at five levels:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>Reader</strong> - This user or group has the ability to read the given area.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Create</strong> - This user or group can create items in a given area.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Edit</strong> - This user or group has the ability to add and edit items in the given area.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Delete</strong> - This user or group can delete items in a given area.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Delegate</strong> - This user or group has the ability to grant/restrict access in the given area by using the Security Settings window. Ability to add, edit and delete.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Site Administrators have access to all areas of the application regardless of security settings.</p><p>The security module allows the site administrator to set the global default security for the system. The default security can be globally changed but should be �thought through� before the production launch of Connections Online. Security can also be set for users or security groups on individual modules within the Org/Dept, Project or People tabs, as well as unique items within the modules.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">User/Group</span></p><p><strong>Default:</strong> these are any Users that log into Connections - in the example below, the Default User can read any Organization or Department Tab. </p>
<p><strong>Organization Editors</strong> are a security group that typically has the executives who are in the system.</p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Editing the Default Security Settings</span></p>

<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Updating Security Using Propagation</span></p>
<p>The security change will propagate �backwards� to all the elements on the security module you are editing.  You will be able to propagate the default security on the site page as well as security elements on the metric and project modules on the organization, department and people tabs within the application.</p>
<p>To propagate the security changes �back to the creation of the element� open the security lock on the page, make the security change, then click the propagate icon for the security module you changed.  An edit window will appear for a choice of three ways to propagate.  Check the one you want and click the �Propagate� button.  A message will appear to tell you that the security has been propagated.  Use the second radial button for most propagation.</p>
<p>The propagation icon is next to the +Add button in any security module <img src="/attachments/token/OOi1HW2Qpxp58c5zl2rbHRTYl/?name=ds5.JPG" alt="ds5.JPG"> it is the lock with the down green arrow.</p>
<p>When you click the Propagation icon, the following opens.  Click the SECOND radial button then Propagate.  PROPAGATE ANY TIME YOU CHANGE SECURITY SETTINGS!</p>
